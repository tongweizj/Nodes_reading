Hey friends, welcome back to the channel.
嗨，朋友们，欢迎回到我的频道。

So, over the last 15 years of being absolutely ==obsessed== with productivity, I have read dozens and dozens and dozens of productivity books, and loads more on Kindle. But this is quite a lot of stuff. In this video, I want to break all of these down into a nine-step framework. These are the nine steps that I've personally distilled from all of these different books and all the research I've done. If you just follow these nine steps, these are the main things that are going to absolutely move the needle for your own productivity.
在我近15年来对提高生产力的无比痴迷中，我已经阅读了数十本关于提高生产力的书籍，还有更多的电子书。这是相当多的材料。在这个视频中，我想将所有这些书籍都归纳成一个九步骤的框架。这些是我从所有这些不同的书籍和我所做的所有研究中提炼出来的九个步骤。如果你只是遵循这九个步骤，这些都是将会极大提升你个人生产力的主要因素。

##  1. set your goals

Alright, step one is to set your goals. This basically involves thinking about where you actually want to go and what is the destination that you're aiming for. 

Because having a destination in mind helps you go on your journey and gives you some sort of direction. Now that doesn't mean that when we set a goal, we should be completely wedded and attached to the outcome that we're striving for. 
好了，第一步是设定你的目标。
基本上，这涉及考虑你实际想要去哪里，以及你正在追求的目的地是什么。
因为拥有一个目标可以帮助你走上你的旅程，并为你提供某种方向。
现在这并不意味着当我们设定目标时，就应该完全执着于我们所期望的结果。

But it does mean that if you really want to be productive (and to me, productivity is about using our time intentionally and effectively to work towards the things that matter to us), we need to actually define what are in fact the things that matter to us.
但这确实意味着，如果你真的想提高生产力（对我来说，生产力是有意识地和有效地利用我们的时间来朝着对我们重要的事情努力工作），我们需要确切地定义对我们重要的事情是什么。

Now, there are various books that talk about dozens and dozens of different ways of doing this. The way that I sort of synthesize all of these is into just three simple steps: 
- think about the long-term, 
- think about the medium-term, 
- and think about the short-term. 
现在，有很多关于如何做到这一点的书籍。我将所有这些书籍合成的方法是将其简化为三个简单的步骤：
- 思考长期，
- 思考中期
- 和思考短期。

### 长期
So, the long-term time horizon is basically like stuff like what do you want written on your gravestone. 
因此，长期的时间跨度基本上是像你想在你的墓碑上写什么样的东西。
。

### 中期
For the medium-term, we're thinking three to five years out, like where do I possibly maybe potentially want to be three or five years down the line
对于中期，我们考虑三到五年的时间，例如在三到五年后，我可能想要去哪里

. Now the crucial thing for all this stuff is that you don't need to have perfect crystal clarity on this, and your goals and your time horizons and stuff are absolutely going to change over time. 
现在所有这些的关键是你不需要对此有完美的清晰度，你的目标和时间跨度等都会随着时间的推移而改变。

But it's really helpful to know right now where do I think I want to be so that I can start moving in that direction, because, as they say, it's much easier to steer a ship that's moving than to steer a ship that's stationary.
但现在非常有帮助的是要知道我现在认为我想要去哪里，以便我可以开始朝那个方向迈进，因为正如人们所说，调整一艘移动的船要比调整一艘停在原地的船容易得多。

### 短期

Then there's the short-term time horizon, which is basically: what are my goals for the year? 
In fact, all three of these methods are in the final chapter of my own book, "Field of Productivity," which you can check out down below. 
然后是短期的时间跨度，基本上是：一年内我有什么目标？

实际上，在我的书《生产力领域》的最后一章中包含了这三种方法，你可以在下面的链接中查看。



Essentially, the way that I think about this short-term time horizon is the 12-month celebration. 
本质上，我考虑这个短期的时间跨度是每周的行动。

In each of the different areas of my life, in work, in health, and in relationships, what do I want to be celebrating 12 months from now? 
在我生活的不同领域，工作、健康和人际关系方面，我想在12个月后庆祝什么？
- Let's say I'm having dinner with a friend, and we're celebrating the progress we've made.
- Maybe on the health front, it's like, "Oh, I'm celebrating that I've been to the gym consistently three times a week for the last 12 months." 
假设我与朋友共进晚餐，我们正在庆祝我们取得的进展。也许在健康方面，我正在庆祝我已经连续12个月每周去健身房三次。
- Maybe on the work front, I'm celebrating hitting a revenue milestone with my business. 
- Maybe on the relationships front, I'm celebrating getting engaged or getting a girlfriend, or whatever the thing might be.
在工作方面，我正在庆祝我的业务达到了一个收入里程碑。也许在人际关系方面，我正在庆祝订婚或找到了女朋友，或者无论是什么事情。

So, if we're condensing all of these different productivity books into this simple nine-step framework, the question that you want to ask yourself is: 
- Am I clear on my goals? 
- What am I actually working towards?

And if you're not clear on that or you don't have an idea, then it's worth sitting down and doing some journaling for just 20 minutes to think about it. And if you're clear on that, then you can move on to the next step.

所以，如果我们将所有这些不同的生产力书籍压缩成这个简单的九步骤框架，你要问自己的问题是：
- 我对我的目标清楚吗？
- 我实际上在追求什么？

如果你对此不清楚或没有主意，那么值得坐下来花点时间进行一些日志记录，只需20分钟来考虑一下。
如果你对此清楚，那么你可以继续下一步。

## 2.break them down
The next step, once you have set your goals, is to break them down. 
It's all well and good having goals, but really setting the goal does not actually help you make progress towards it. 

It's better than nothing, but obviously there are a load of steps involved once you've set the goal to actually making it happen. 

Therefore, this step is really all about breaking our goals down into what are the tangible actions that we can take to make progress towards those goals.

一旦你设定了目标，下一步是拆分目标。
设定目标当然是很好的事情，但是实际上设定目标并不会帮助你朝这个目标迈进。
这比什么都不做要好，但显然，一旦设定了目标，实际上要实现它还需要很多步骤。
因此，这一步实际上是将我们的目标分解成我们可以采取的切实行动的具体措施。

Again, depending on how many of these productivity books you read, there are dozens of ways of trying to figure this out. 

I like to keep things simple and boil it down to the basics, which is basically the question of, =="What inputs do I need to do on a weekly basis that are going to get me to this particular goal?" ==

For example, for health, if the goal is to build muscle, or you can turn that into a SMART goal if you really want to, then the weekly input would be weight training three times a week with progressive overload. If the goal is, "I want to write my first book," then the weekly input would be, "I want to spend 10 hours a week writing."

同样，根据你阅读了多少关于提高生产力的书籍，有数十种不同的方法来尝试解决这个问题。
我喜欢保持简单，并将其简化为基本要素，即“我需要每周采取什么样的输入措施，这些措施将使我朝着这个特定目标取得进展？”
例如，对于健康，如果目标是增肌，或者你可以将其转化为SMART目标，如果你真的愿意的话，那么每周的输入将是每周进行三次体重训练，具有渐进过载效应。

如果目标是“我想写我的第一本书”，那么每周的输入将是“我想每周花费10小时写作”。

I don't really believe in making a task list and breaking the goal down into the 18,000 different things it takes to make the goal because that becomes way too complicated. 

A lot of kind of balancing reading about productivity advice with actually doing the thing is finding that sweet spot where you're taking the advice on board because the advice is generally good, but it's not so overboard that it starts to become overwhelming.
在平衡阅读关于提高生产力的建议和实际执行任务之间，找到那个恰到好处的点是关键，你需要将这些建议纳入考虑，因为这些建议通常是很好的，但也不要过于沉湎其中，以至于开始变得令人不知所措。

So, just to simplify all of this down: ==What are the things that we need to do every week to make progress towards this goal? ==
Once we're clear on that, we move on to step number three.
要朝着这个目标取得进展，我们每周需要做哪些事情呢？

## 3.create time blocks

Step number three is one of the most important ones, which is to create time blocks. Essentially, here the idea is that 
- we need to make the time for these different things that we've decided, these weekly inputs; 
- we need to make the time for those things in our calendar. 
第三步是最重要的一步之一，即创建时间块。
基本上，这里的想法是我们需要为那些我们决定要做的不同事情划定时间；我们需要在日历中为这些事情腾出时间。

My favorite method for this is called the Ideal Week Technique. 
我最喜欢的方法是称为"理想一周技巧"。

Basically, that involves just creating a new Google Calendar, calling it your ideal week, and creating calendar events for what time you want to wake up, what time you want to go to sleep, what time you're having lunch, what time you're at work, what time you're hanging out with your friends and family, date night, and all that stuff. 
基本上，这涉及到创建一个新的Google日历，将其命名为你的理想一周，然后为你想要起床的时间、想要睡觉的时间、吃午饭的时间、工作时间、与朋友和家人相处的时间、约会之夜等创建日历事件。

==You start off creating the blocks of time for the things that you have to do, and then you can move on to creating blocks of time for the things that you want to do.==
你首先要为你必须做的事情创建时间块，然后可以继续创建你想要做的事情的时间块。

There's some nuance there; "have to do" can often be reframed to "want to do" in your own mind. 
We can often choose to feel as if we have more autonomy in situations than we actually do. 
这里有一些微妙之处；"必须做的"通常可以在你自己的心中重新构建成"想要做的"。我们通常可以选择感觉我们在情况中有更多的自主权，而实际情况并非总是如此。

Fundamentally, the Ideal Week Technique and using a calendar tells you how much time you have available to actually give to these things that you care about. 
从根本上说，理想一周技巧和使用日历告诉你，你有多少时间可以用来真正投入到你关心的事情中。

For example, if my goal is to build more muscle and get six-pack abs or whatever the thing is, and I know that I need to do weight training three times a week for an hour, that means I need to find three one-hour blocks of time in my calendar, and then maybe with some buffer on either side for getting to the gym and getting back home.
例如，如果我的目标是增肌并拥有六块腹肌，或者无论目标是什么，我知道我需要每周做一小时的力量训练三次，这意味着我需要在我的日历中找到三个一小时的时间块，然后可能在去健身房和回家的路上留出一些缓冲时间。

Now, if I physically don't have those blocks of time in my calendar because, let's say, I'm working two jobs and have a family, then it's going to be very, very difficult for me to actually make progress towards that goal. 

So, what we're doing here in step three is we're really using our calendar as a truth-telling tool to figure out how much time do we actually have available for this thing. 
现在，如果我的日历中实际上没有这些时间块，因为比方说我正在做两份工作并且有一个家庭，那么我实际上将很难朝着那个目标取得进展。因此，我们在第三步所做的是，我们真正将我们的日历用作一个揭示真相的工具，以弄清楚我们实际上有多少时间可以用于这个事情。

Because if we don't have the time for it, then we're just kind of living in la-la land and thinking that we're going to make progress on this thing when, in fact, we're not actually making the time for it. 

So, the next time we sit down to watch Netflix for three hours or scroll through social media, it's worth asking, "Am I making time for this thing that really matters to me, or am I just kind of wasting my time?"
因为如果我们没有时间，那么我们只是在幻想，认为我们会在这件事上取得进展，而实际上我们并没有真正为它腾出时间。所以，下次当我们坐下来连续观看三个小时的Netflix或者浏览社交媒体时，值得问一下："我是否为这个对我非常重要的事情腾出了时间，还是我只是在浪费时间？"

##  4.time batching
Okay, step four is time batching. Time batching is a concept that was made popular by a guy called ==Paul Graham==. The basic idea here is that it takes us a little bit of time to get into the groove of a particular task. 
好的，第四步是时间分批处理。时间分批处理是一个由一位名叫保罗·格雷厄姆的人推广开来的概念。基本思想是，我们需要一点时间来适应特定任务的状态。

For example, if you're going to be doing some writing or programming or whatever it is that you do, you're going to have to get into the groove of that task, and that takes some time and mental energy. 

However, once you're in the groove of it, it's generally easier to stay in the groove and to be productive on that task.
例如，如果你要写作、编程或者进行其他工作，你需要一些时间和精力来适应这项任务。然而，一旦你适应了这种任务，通常就更容易保持在这种状态并且在这项任务上保持高效。

So, the idea here is that instead of trying to do 30 minutes of writing, then 30 minutes of emails, and then 30 minutes of another task, we actually batch our tasks together into larger chunks of time. For example, you might do three hours of deep work in the morning, then have a break, and then do two hours of emails and communication stuff in the afternoon.
所以，这里的想法是，与其尝试进行30分钟的写作，然后30分钟的处理电子邮件，再30分钟的其他任务，我们实际上将任务分组成更大的时间块。
例如，你可以在早上连续工作三个小时，然后休息一下，然后在下午进行两个小时的电子邮件和沟通工作。

By batching similar tasks together, you can take advantage of being in that state of mind and be much more productive. It saves you that energy of switching between different types of tasks. The key here is to identify what are the different kinds of work you do and try to batch them together. You don't need to do this for everything, but for the main things that really require deep focus and concentration, batching can be incredibly effective.
通过将类似的任务分组在一起，你可以充分利用那种心态，更高效地工作。这样做可以节省你在不同类型任务之间切换时的精力。

关键在于识别出你做的工作的不同种类，并尝试将它们分批处理在一起。你不需要对所有事情都这样做，但对于那些真正需要深度关注和集中注意力的主要任务，分批处理可能非常有效。

## 5.deep work
Now, moving on to step five, this is a concept that's been popularized by Cal Newport in his book "Deep Work." The idea here is to eliminate shallow work and embrace deep work. 

Shallow work is the stuff that we do all day long that's kind of mindless and doesn't require a lot of cognitive effort, like checking emails, scrolling through social media, or attending meetings that might not be super productive.
现在，进入第五步，这是卡尔·纽波特在他的《深度工作》一书中推广的一个概念。 
这里的想法是消除浅层工作并拥抱深层工作。 
浅层工作是我们整天做的事情，有点无意识，不需要太多的认知努力，比如检查电子邮件、浏览社交媒体或参加可能效率不高的会议。

Deep work, on the other hand, is the really focused, concentrated work that produces high-quality results. This is where you're in the flow, and you're really making progress on your most important tasks. 
另一方面，深度工作是真正专注、集中的工作，可以产生高质量的结果。 这就是你的心流状态，你在最重要的任务上确实取得了进展。 

The key here is to try to eliminate or minimize shallow work and create more time for deep work in your schedule. One way to do this is to set specific times during the day for checking emails and attending to shallow tasks, and then block off larger chunks of time for deep work. 

This way, you're not constantly switching between shallow and deep work, which can be very disruptive to your productivity.
这里的关键是尝试消除或尽量减少浅层工作，并在日程中为深度工作创造更多时间。 一种方法是在一天中设定特定的时间来检查电子邮件和处理浅层任务，然后留出更多时间进行深度工作。 这样，您就不会不断地在浅层工作和深层工作之间切换，这可能会严重影响您的工作效率。
## 6.distractions
In step six, we're talking about distractions. Distractions are the arch-nemesis of productivity. They can come in many forms, from notifications on your phone to noisy coworkers to the lure of social media. 

To be more productive, you need to identify and eliminate or at least minimize these distractions. One effective strategy is to create a distraction-free work environment. This might involve turning off notifications, using website blockers to limit your access to distracting websites, or finding a quiet place to work where you won't be interrupted.
在第六步中，我们讨论干扰。 
分心是生产力的大敌。 
它们可以有多种形式，从手机上的通知到吵闹的同事，再到社交媒体的诱惑。 

为了提高工作效率，您需要识别并消除或至少尽量减少这些干扰。 
一种有效的策略是创造一个无干扰的工作环境。 
这可能涉及关闭通知、使用网站拦截器来限制您访问分散注意力的网站，或者找到一个不会被打扰的安静工作场所。

Another important aspect of managing distractions is practicing mindfulness and staying focused on your work. You can use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, which involves working in short, focused bursts with regular breaks, to help you stay on track. The key here is to be aware of your distractions and take proactive steps to minimize them.

管理干扰的另一个重要方面是练习正念并专注于工作。 
您可以使用番茄工作法等技巧，该方法涉及短暂、集中的工作并定期休息，以帮助您保持正轨。 这里的关键是要意识到你的干扰，并采取积极主动的措施来尽量减少它们。

## 7.optimizing your energy
Alright, step seven is about optimizing your energy. 
好吧，第七步是关于优化你的能量。

==Productivity isn't just about managing your time; it's also about managing your energy==. 
生产力不仅仅在于管理你的时间；还在于管理你的时间。 这也与管理你的能量有关。
You need to understand when you're most energized and focused during the day and schedule your most important and challenging tasks during those times. 
您需要了解一天中什么时候最精力充沛、注意力最集中，并在这些时间安排最重要和最具挑战性的任务。

For example, if you're a morning person, you might want to tackle your deep work tasks in the morning when your energy levels are highest.
例如，如果您是一个早起的人，您可能希望在早晨精力最高的时候处理深度工作任务。

Additionally, it's important to take regular breaks to recharge your energy. 
The Pomodoro Technique, which I mentioned earlier, is a great way to do this. It involves working for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break. This helps prevent burnout and keeps your energy levels consistent throughout the day.
此外，==定期休息以补充能量也很重要==。 我之前提到的番茄工作法是做到这一点的好方法。 它包括工作 25 分钟，然后休息 5 分钟。 这有助于防止倦怠并保持您全天的能量水平一致。

## 8.accountability

In step eight, we're talking about accountability. It's important to hold yourself accountable for your goals and tasks. 

One effective way to do this is to share your goals with someone else, like a friend, family member, or a coach, who can help keep you on track. You can also use accountability apps and tools to track your progress and stay motivated.
在第八步中，我们讨论问责制。 让自己对自己的目标和任务负责非常重要。 一种有效的方法是与其他人分享您的目标，例如朋友、家人或教练，他们可以帮助您保持正轨。 您还可以使用问责应用程序和工具来跟踪您的进度并保持动力。

Another aspect of accountability is setting deadlines for yourself. Deadlines create a sense of urgency and help you stay focused on your tasks. You can use techniques like time blocking to allocate specific time slots for completing tasks and meeting deadlines.
问责制的另一个方面是为自己设定最后期限。 最后期限会产生紧迫感并帮助您专注于任务。 您可以使用时间限制等技术来分配特定的时间段来完成任务并满足截止日期。

## 9.reflection and improvement
Finally, step nine is all about reflection and improvement. It's important to regularly review your goals and progress to see what's working and what's not. 

This allows you to make adjustments and continuously improve your productivity system. You can use techniques like weekly or monthly reviews to assess your performance and identify areas for growth.
最后，第九步是反思和改进。
定期检查您的目标和进度以了解哪些有效、哪些无效非常重要。 
这使您能够做出调整并不断改进您的生产力系统。 
您可以使用每周或每月回顾等技巧来评估您的表现并确定需要改进的领域。

So, those are the nine steps to boost your productivity. Remember that productivity is a personal journey, and what works for one person may not work for another. It's important to experiment with these strategies and adapt them to your own needs and preferences. Ultimately, the goal is to use your time and energy more effectively so you can achieve your goals and live a more fulfilling life.
因此，这些是提高生产力的九个步骤。 
请记住，生产力是一种个人旅程，对一个人有效的方法可能对其他人无效。 
尝试这些策略并根据您自己的需求和偏好进行调整非常重要。 
最终的目标是更有效地利用您的时间和精力，以便实现您的目标并过上更充实的生活。
